# Jenkins #

A jenkins docker-compose file which uses local storage rather than a volume

### What is this ###

* Jenkins running in a container with locla storage...bit of distaster, as the point of local storage was to commit the plugins/job setups to git, however jenkins is HUGE, so kind fo pointless. Better off redoing the whole thing in a volume
